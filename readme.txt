The Leverage FeatureBox widget enables you to quickly and easily create a quick call to action to convert visitors into email subscribers.

== Description ==

This responsive widget perfectly adjusts to any widgetized area of your website that you choose: feature area, sidebar, footer, and before or after-post areas.  The separate input areas for title, copy, and auto-responder code outputs on separate, double-spaced lines so you can quickly create a call to action without worrying about formatting.
