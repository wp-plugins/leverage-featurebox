The Leverage FeatureBox widget creates responsive, formatted, high converting optin feature boxes that turn your website visitors into subscribers. 

== Description ==

The Leverage FeatureBox widget is the easiest, most powerful way for you to quickly and easily create a professional, compelling call to action within any widgetized area of your WordPress website.  

The Leverage FeatureBox widget enables you create beautiful optin/feature boxes to grow your email list and your business.

You don't need to know how to code to get great results.  This responsive widget adjusts to any widgetized area of your website that you choose: feature area, sidebar, footer, and before or after-post areas.  The separate input areas for title, copy, and auto-responder code outputs on separate, double-spaced lines so you can quickly create a call to action without worrying about formatting.

### What is a Featurebox?
A featurebox (also commonly called an optin form or optin box) was originally named after the feature area on the homepage right beneath the header before any content.  The Leverage FeatureBox Widget is different because it isn't limited to just the feature area of the homepage.  It can be dropped in and configured for any widgetized area of your WordPress theme.  It is responsive so it contracts or expands to fit any sized widget area.

### Why you should use the Leverage FeatureBox Widget?
You worked hard to attract visitors to your website.  But very few potential buyers are ready to buy the first time they discover your website.  Instead of having potential buyers leave your site never to return, ask them to optin to your email list or newsletter.  The Leverage Featurebox widget allows you to ask visitors to optin anywhere you have a widget area on your website.  When you are able to professionally make a call to action and provide compelling reasons to join your email list, potential buyers will optin to your email list.  Then when they are ready to buy, you'll have the opportunity to make the sale.

### Is it difficult to create an Optin FeatureBox?
The Leverage FeatureBox is easy to use.  You just drop it into the widget area, enter a title, copy/body text, autoresponder code (from any autoresponder company like MailChimp or Aweber that creates the email entry box and button), and upload your custom image in 4 simple steps.  The Leverage FeatureBox allows you to focus on getting more subscribers and making more sales instead of the technical minutiae.  You no longer have to hire a designer/coder to create a custom optin.  The responsive Leverage Featurebox widget adjusts to fit any widgetized area in your theme:  Homepage featurebox, before post, after-post, sidebar, or footer areas.  Just install the Leverage FeatureBox Plugin and start building your email list and grow your business.
